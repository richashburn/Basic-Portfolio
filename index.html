            <p>I'm Rich Ashburn.  My family moved to Richmond in 2018 and we love it.  In Denver, my wife and I owned a hair salon for 16 years and I taught elementary school.  We decided it was time for a little change in our lives so we sold the business and moved to Richmond.  We couldn't be happier with our decision!  Riding the wave of change, I decided to pivot away from teaching and try something I was interested in, web development.  After telling kids for years to become life long learners - I decided to take my own advice.</p>
            <p>
            In addition to web development, I'm learning about the hiking paths along the James River, trying to teach myself the banjo and debating if my daughter's quest to become a circus performer is "college fund worthy".
